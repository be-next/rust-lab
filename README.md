# ðŸ”¬ rust-lab

Experiments, tests, and insights on Rust and its ecosystem.

All experimentations are documented in the `topics` directory, organized by topic (see below).

## Topics

- [Error Handling in Rust](topics/rust-error-handling/README.md)
- [Smart Pointers in Rust](topics/rust-smart-pointers/README.md)

## Utilities

### Bacon

[`bacon`](https://crates.io/crates/bacon) is an automatic monitoring tool for Rust (but not only), which detects changes in your source code and automatically restarts builds, tests or other commands. It is particularly useful for code experimentation and TDD development.

```bash
bacon run -- -q --example <rust-example-file>
```
